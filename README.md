# Team 254's 2013 Robot Code

This repository contains the Team 254 2013 FRC codebase. This code is released under the BSD 2-clause license. A copy of this license is included in COPYING.

Unlike previous years, we used Java instead of C++, and were very happy with the results. Our members learn Java in class, and more students were ultimately able to contribute to the codebase. It also meant a simpler, OS-independent build process that made development easier.

## Contents

This year's codebase can be opened and conveniently browsed in the NetBeans IDE. Code lives in the src/ directory and is organized in directories based on functionality and Java package.
